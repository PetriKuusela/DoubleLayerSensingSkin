# DoubleLayerSensingSkin
Code package for electrical impedance tomography based double layer sensing skin. This package is mainly meant for reproducing the results shown in publication (link here once it is published). For further use and modifications, the OOEIT1.1 package (https://github.com/PetriKuusela/OOEIT) is strongly recommended. If you are interested in working wiht the double layer sensing skin codes from this package, please contact me (petri.k.kuusela@gmail.com), and I can make you a version that runs with the cleaner OOEIT1.1 package.

## How to use
To use this package to reproduce the results, you should first download all the contents into a single folder. Next, unzip all the zip-files into folders having the same names as the files have. Also, create folders "simulations" and "realdata", for the outputs. All the results are ran by running the file "Driver_Article_metadriver.m".
